# QMsolve: A module for solving and visualizing the Schrödinger equation

QMsolve seeks to provide a solid and easy to use solver, capable of solving the Schrödinger equation for one and two particles, 
and creating descriptive and stunning visualizations of its solutions both in 1D, 2D, and 3D.

## Notes
This fork of the QMsolve project aims to improve the parallel GPU-based solvers in order to realize improved computational efficiency and reduce memory usage. 

For installation, usage, and additional examples, refer to the original QMsolve repo. The examples provided in this fork are meant to demonstrate improved functionality only.
